# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+
**Primary Dependencies**: UV, pytest
**Storage**: Git
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: single-project
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Test-Driven Development**: Are tests written before implementation?
- [ ] **Modern Python with Type Hints**: Is the code using Python 3.12+ with type hints?
- [ ] **Clean and Readable Code**: Does the code adhere to PEP 8 and is it easy to understand?
- [ ] **Architectural Decision Records**: Are important architectural decisions documented in ADRs?
- [ ] **SOLID, DRY, KISS Principles**: Does the code follow these OOP principles?
- [ ] **Technical Stack**: Does the project use the approved technical stack (Python 3.12+, UV, pytest, Git)?
- [ ] **Quality Requirements**: Does the project meet the quality requirements (all tests pass, >=80% code coverage, use of dataclasses)?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
